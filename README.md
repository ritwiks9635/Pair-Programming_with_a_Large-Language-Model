**What is pair programming with llm?**
AI pair programming is being rapidly adopted by developers to help with tasks across the tech stack, from catching bugs to quickly inserting entire code snippets. We will learn how to use an LLM in pair programming to: Simplify and improve your code. Write test cases. Debug and refactor your code.

**What is PaLM API used for?**
The PaLM API is the legacy API that allowed developers access to Google's large language models such as text-bison-001 . If you're just starting your journey with large language models, check out the Gemini API overview to access the latest API and models

Google's PaLM API is a model-based API that allows developers to use large language models (LLMs) to build language applications. It provides access to Google's latest LLMs, including models that are optimized for multi-turn use cases like chat and content generation, and general purpose models for use cases like classification and summarization. 
The PaLM API offers multiple text-generation services, including a text service for single-turn interactions and a chat service for interactive, multi-turn conversations. You can use the PaLM API's text generation features to: Find available models, Generate text, Stop generation early, and Get alternate model responses. 

**To get started with the PaLM API, you can:**

1. Download and install the PaLM API Python library
2. Create an API key
3. Use the palm.list_models function to find available models
4. Use the palm.generate_text method to generate text 

Palm API provides multiple text-generation services, such as text service to generate text and a chat service to generate chat conversations. Google generative-ai is the Palm API Python Library and can be easily installed using the pip command.
